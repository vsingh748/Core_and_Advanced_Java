<h2> Why is java called java? And why was java intoduced? </h2>

<p> Java was invented by James Gosling, Partick Naughton, Chris Wrath, Ed Frank and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in 1991. It was
originally called "Oak" because of the Oak tree which stood infront of their office. Then it was discovered that this word had already been
taken so they renamed it as Green and then Java. Naming java as Java is a hoamge to the large amouunt of Java coffee the team consumed. 

At Bell Labs, Ken Thompson invented a programming language called B which led to development of C in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie. This led to C++ 
which was earlier called "C with Classes". Then came Java which is a pure object oriented programming language. It's main feature is Platform 
independence or Architectural Neurality. </p>

<h2> Is java compiled or interpreted? </h2>
<p> Interestingly enough, some implementations of Java are implemented as both interpreted and compiled – all at once. This is actually dependent on the JVM – Java is usually compiled down to the byte code by the Java compiler. But whether the JVM interprets or compiles that byte code is dependent on which JVM is being used. The difference between a JVM that compiles the byte code and a JVM that interprets the byte code is that an interpreting JVM will both translate the byte code and execute it at the same time as well, but with a JVM compiler the translation only occurs once, because an executable file is created in compilation. And that is the key difference between the two – although nowadays with just in time compilation the distinction is becoming a bit blurred. source- quora </p>
