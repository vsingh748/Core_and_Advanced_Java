<h2> Why is java called java? And why was java intoduced? </h2>

<p> Java was invented by James Gosling, Partick Naughton, Chris Wrath, Ed Frank and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in 1991. It was
originally called "Oak" because of the Oak tree which stood infront of their office. Then it was discovered that this word had already been
taken so they renamed it as Green and then Java. Naming java as Java is a hoamge to the large amouunt of Java coffee the team consumed. 

At Bell Labs, Ken Thompson invented a programming language called B which led to development of C in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie. This led to C++ 
which was earlier called "C with Classes". Then came Java which is a pure object oriented programming language. It's main feature is Platform 
independence or Architectural Neurality. </p>
